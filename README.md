# NSW Property Market Analysis

## 📌 Introduction
The property market in New South Wales (NSW) has experienced a drastic increase in housing prices, with annual surges of nearly 10%. This has contributed to an ongoing property crisis driven by several factors:
- Immigration for education and work opportunities  
- Limited housing supply compared to rising demand  
- Interest from foreign investors  
- Strong inflow of skilled workers and business professionals  

This project explores the relationship between house sales in NSW and key socio-economic factors such as **income levels, number of earners, and median property prices**. The analysis focuses on multiple Local Government Areas (LGAs) across NSW.

## 🎯 Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:
1. Predict the number of house sales across LGAs using income data.  
2. Cluster LGAs based on rent, sales, and income characteristics.  
3. Perform **linear regression** to study income–sales relationships.  
4. Apply **train-test splits** and **R² scoring** to measure model performance.  
5. Build **K-means clustering models** for property segmentation.  
6. Use a **classification model** to categorize LGAs by housing affordability trends.  
7. Calculate the **mean rental cost** and **mean sales price** for all LGAs.
